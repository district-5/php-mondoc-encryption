# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is not expected that the Mondoc Encryption library will have any issues supporting older versions of releases.

Additionally, we endeavour to always support the latest version of Mondoc, and the latest version of PHP.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| *       | :white_check_mark: |

Please note, you should also refer to the Mondoc library for any security vulnerabilities, as this library is simply
an extension to Mondoc, to provide a limited function.
